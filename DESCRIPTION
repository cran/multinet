Note: a previous version of the library (main version number: 3) was
        developed as part of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research
        and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 727040
        (Virt-EU). The package uses functions from eclat
        <https://borgelt.net/eclat.html>, for association rule mining,
        Infomap <https://www.mapequation.org>, for the Infomap
        community detection method (please refer to their web site for
        up-to-date code), and Howard Hinnant's date and time library
        <https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date>. The code from these
        libraries has been included in our source package.
